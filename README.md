# Rock Breaker
This is a calculator that will determine whether or not a rock can be broken with the current loadout of the ship in star citizen

## Planned features:
    - calculate whether it is possible with the current loadout (laser + modules)
    - calculate whether it is possible using multiple ships
## Possible extra features:
    - Expected profit / SCU of desired materials
    - Raw material profit
    - Predicted SCU collected based on free / available SCU storage, clustering and expected SCU of desired materials
